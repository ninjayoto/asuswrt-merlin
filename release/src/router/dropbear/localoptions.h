default_options.h  documents compile-time options, and provides default values.

Local customisation should be added to localoptions.h which is
used if it exists. Options defined there will override any options in this
file.

Options can also be defined with -DDROPBEAR_XXX=[0,1] in Makefile CFLAGS

IMPORTANT: Some options will require "make clean" after changes */
